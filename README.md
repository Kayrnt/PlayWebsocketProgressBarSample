Play Websocket Progress Bar Sample
==============================

A sample of use of WebSocket with Play Framework 2 using Scala to make a progress bar. The sample also makes use of AngularJS and Akka. 

Base example shows the simple way without Akka.
Akka example shows a bit more advanced example that show a process started in the background and progression isn't "destroyed" when you refresh the page thanks to Akka actors.

It might be a bit hacky so if you want to clean it up, you can send pull requests.
